After not working on the slam robot for a long time, I wanted to try launching
it again. I did rosdep update, removed build and devel content, reinitialised
rosdep by deleting the file that command creates. 

The main isssue tat popped up was: 
[ WARN] [1581873062.088918257]: The 'state_publisher' executable is deprecated. Please use 'robot_state_publisher' instead
[ WARN] [1581873062.090446627]: The root link base_link has an inertia specified in the URDF, but KDL does not support a root link with an inertia.  As a workaround, you can add an extra dummy link to your URDF.
[WARN] [1581873062.358363]: The 'use_gui' parameter was specified, which is deprecated.  We'll attempt to find and run the GUI, but if this fails you should install the 'joint_state_publisher_gui' package instead and run that.  This backwards compatibility option will be removed in Noetic.
[ERROR] [1581873062.358882]: Could not find the GUI, install the 'joint_state_publisher_gui' package

Basically giving me trouble about wanting the GUI for sending Twist msgs to the
wheels. 

The solution: 

The error was not in my code, but rather logical. I tried to control the wheels
of the rviz representation by sending twist messages, but there was no node to
receive those Twist messages and turn them into wheel velocities running.
Because rviz still needs a robot to connect to! Either a simulated robot or a
real one, but rviz alone is not enough. 

I realised this after launching my old robot's gazebo package (pre-sock).
