I got the gslam mapping to work by using the following packages which I tested
upfront: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DelftX+ROS1x+1T2020/courseware/c522275e81dc4c04be2916d98601e3bf/28313344104546849d6cc1611dc393c7/

I created the sock_2dnav package according to this tutorial: https://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup

But instead of populating it as they suggest, I copied everything from the
config folder from the husky_navigation package to the config folder of the
sock_2dnav. I also copied the gmapping.launch, move_base.launch and
gmapping_demo.launch file. In the gmapping.launch file I changed the default topic for the
laserscan to sock/laser/scan instead of just scan and in the
costmap_common.yaml file I also changed the laser topic to sock/laser/scan. 

Then by running:

roslaunch sock_gazebo sock_gazebo.launch

and

roslaunch sock_2dnav gmapping_demo.launch

It works exactly like in the edx tutorial. 

Next up: 
I can't give it a 2dnav goal in rviz (this is possible in the husky_navigation
package). The error is: 

[ERROR] [1581885016.454223351, 336.624000000]: The goal pose passed to this planner must be in the map frame.  It is instead in the base_link frame.

It's not entirely necessary though, since I can also move the robot around in
RViZ. I could also try to save the map and then follow this tutorial to
navigate it: https://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup. At the
bottom the tutorial talks about setting up rviz for giving navigation goals. 

First it would be good to put the sock robot in willowgarage, so it has a fixed
map and I don't need to map it every time.
